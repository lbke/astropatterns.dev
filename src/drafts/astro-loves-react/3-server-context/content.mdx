# Using React Context in Astro










It's very common to allow the users of a website to download static files.

Images are the most common type of static files, 
your website probably has a logo or a picture somewhere on the homepage. You may also share your CV in PDF format, your startup pitch deck, the recipe for the best lasagna...

The `/public` folder of Astro apps allows for the sharing of static files. 
But as the name implies, files in this folder are available to anyone.

The `/public` folder is not suitable for private files and other complex situations.

**How can we handle private files efficiently?**

## Advanced file streaming use cases

This pattern covers the following use cases:

- **Private files:** You want to check some permissions before serving "extremely_confidential_report.docx".
- **Personalized files:** A generic url "/user/profile-picture" may serve a different image depending on the currently logged-in user.
- **Generated files:** The State of JavaScript survey backoffice app generates CSV exports of the current responses. This means that we generate the file on the fly when we receive an export request.

We can't use the `/public` folder for that. We have to craft a more elaborate API endpoint to serve the files.
In Astro, we call API endpoints ["Server Endpoints"](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/endpoints/#server-endpoints-api-routes) or "API Routes". 

**Let's stream a file from a server endpoint.**

## ðŸ”¨ Practice: how to stream a file from a server endpoint

Take a look at the codebase. 
It demonstrates a page displaying an image that should be streamed from a server endpoint.

import SkipPractice from "@/components/SkipPractice.mdx"

<SkipPractice />

- Read the documentation for Node.js [`filehandle.readableWebStream`](https://nodejs.org/docs/v20.16.0/api/fs.html#filehandlereadablewebstreamoptions)
- Use this function to transform the file stream into a webstream. 
**You will need the "bytes" option.**
- The image should appear on the website.
- You are done! ðŸŽ‰


## Performance impact

It's commonplace to read the file entirely in a variable, instead of streaming it.

```ts
import fs from 'node:fs/promises';
// if the file weighs 6 gygabytes,
// your RAM consumption will increase by 6GB!!
const data = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');
```

With streaming, the file is read and sent by chunks.
The chart below illustrates the memory consumption of both approaches,
for a big zip archive. Streaming is much more efficient.

## What about closing the file?

You'll notice that since we use a `return` keyword
to send the HTTP response,
we never have a chance to properly close the file.

We have 2 options here:
- Do not use a stream, instead read the file in memory and send it as a response.
It's totally ok for small files unless you have a really huge traffic on your website.
- Use features from your hosting provider that allows waiting for the stream to be closed before killing a serverless function.
Vercel, Cloudflare and Netlify have worked on a `waitUntil` feature to achieve that.

:::info
It seems weird that it's so difficult to close a file after sending an HTTP response, right?
This is because Astro, similarly to Next.js, supports serverless deployments.
And in the serverless paradigm, 
sending an HTTP response may end the execution of the function.
