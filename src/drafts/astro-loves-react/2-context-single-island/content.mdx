# Using React Context in Astro

Astro selective hydration creates an incompatibility with React Context.
Let's figure how to work around this limitation.

## Context in React

*You may skip this section if you are already familiar with React Context.*

In React, we pass data from a parent component to its children using "props".
This may become tedious 
if the component that renders the data is deeply nested in the component tree.
We call that "props drilling".

```tsx
// 
function Parent() {
  const data = "parent data";
  return <Child data={data} />;
}
function Child({ data }) {
  return <GrandChild data={data} />;
}
function GrandChild({ data }) {
  return <SuperGrandChild data={data} />;
}
// ...and so on
```

Context allows passing data from a parent component to its grand-children or below
without having to pass the data through intermediate components.

A Context Provider defines a context,
and the `useContext` hook can consume this context.

```tsx
import { createContext, useState, useContext } from "react";

const MyContext = createContext();

function MyProvider({ children }) {
  const [data, setData] = useState("provider data");
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={data}>
  {children}
  </MyContext.Provider>
  )
}

function MyConsumer() {
  const data = useContext(MyContext);
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

## Islands in Astro

Astro introduces a concept of "islands of interactivity".
The plural matters : one page may contain multiple islands.

This means that your React components are not automatically interconnected.

In this example, the `Child` component
won't be able to read a context set by `ParentContext`!

At best, they can display the default context value,
but it will never be initialized with the context provider value
and won't receive any update.


```astro
// index.astro
import { ParentContext } from "./ParentContext"
import { GrandChild } from "./GrandChild"
---
{/** These are separate islands! */}
<ParentContext>
    <Child />
<ParentContext/>
```

## The Australian architecture : a massive island

If your Astro app is very interactive
and uses React code everywhere,
you might consider making it a single, big React island.

It's possible to use React Context within such an island.

```
// MyReactApp.tsx
// This whole component is a single island
import { ParentContext } from "./ParentContext"
import { GrandChild } from "./GrandChild"
export function MyReactApp() {
    return (
        <ParentContext>
    <Child />
<ParentContext/>
    )
```

:::info
This architecture would be similar to how Next.js App Router works,
with a single React instance instead of multiple islands.
:::



Using a React context in an Astro application is tricky.


At best, you can display the context default value.
You can't initialize this value when rendering the context provider,
nor updating the context.
