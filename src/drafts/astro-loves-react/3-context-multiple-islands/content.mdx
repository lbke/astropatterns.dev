# Using React Context in Astro

Astro selective hydration creates an incompatibility with React Context.
Let's figure how to work around this limitation.

## Context in React

*You may skip this section if you are already familiar with React Context.*

In React, we pass data from a parent component to its children using "props".
This may become tedious 
if the component that renders the data is deeply nested in the component tree.
We call that "props drilling".

```tsx
// 
function Parent() {
  const data = "parent data";
  return <Child data={data} />;
}
function Child({ data }) {
  return <GrandChild data={data} />;
}
function GrandChild({ data }) {
  return <SuperGrandChild data={data} />;
}
// ...and so on
```

Context allows passing data from a parent component to its grand-children or below
without having to pass the data through intermediate components.

A Context Provider defines a context,
and the `useContext` hook can consume this context.

```tsx
import { createContext, useState, useContext } from "react";

const MyContext = createContext();

function MyProvider({ children }) {
  const [data, setData] = useState("provider data");
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={data}>
  {children}
  </MyContext.Provider>
  )
}

function MyConsumer() {
  const data = useContext(MyContext);
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

## Islands in Astro

Astro introduces a concept of "islands of interactivity".
The plural matters : one page may contain multiple islands.

This means that your React components are not automatically interconnected.

In this example, the `Child` component
won't be able to read a context set by `ParentContext`!

At best, they can display the default context value,
but it will never be initialized with the context provider value
and won't receive any update.


```astro
// index.astro
import { ParentContext } from "./ParentContext"
import { GrandChild } from "./GrandChild"
---
{/** These are separate islands! */}
<ParentContext>
    <Child />
<ParentContext/>
```
