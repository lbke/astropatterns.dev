# Welcome to AstroPatterns

Welcome to AstroPatterns!

This course is exercise-centric. 
I describe a problem and how to fix it. 
Then, you can practice on a real application.

If you are not in the mood for practice, 
you can also jump to the solution directly.

You don't need to install anything on your computer.
AstroPatterns relies on [WebContainers](https://webcontainers.io/) via the [TutorialKit framework](https://tutorialkit.dev/), 
a wonderful piece of technology that lets us run fullstack applications directly in your browser.

Take a few minutes to explore the interface.

You'll find:
- a code editor with code samples demonstrating the problem we want to solve
- a button to check the solution
- a preview of a running Astro application

The code is merged into a running Astro application, 
and the result is what you see the preview section.

You can edit the code and see the changes happen in real-time!

Now that you are more familiar with the interface, 
let's move to the first lesson : patterns to write the best possible one-page website.
